The CommCare XForm specification is a subset of the far larger [XForm 1.0 specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms/). It contains a few additional features not found in the XForm specification. 

This specification continues to evolve. On the web you will often see references to _JavaRosa_ and _OpenRosa_ when the spec is discussed. OpenRosa was the name of the [initial specification](https://bitbucket.org/javarosa/javarosa/wiki/xform) that formed the basis of this specification. JavaRosa is the name of a Java library that implements the OpenRosa specification. JavaRosa, OpenRosa are still often used to refer to the same, but we recommend using this document to build tools that are compliant with the CommCare Ecosystem.

The document assumes at least a fair understanding of XML and XPath. It is also useful to refer to [XForms 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-xforms-20031014/) for details about shared features.
