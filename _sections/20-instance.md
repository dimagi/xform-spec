title: Instance
---

A `<model>` can have multiple instances as childnodes. The first and required `<instance>` is called the _primary instance_ and represents the data structure of the record that will be created and submitted with the form. Additional instances are called _secondary instances_.

### Primary Instance 

The primary instance should contain a single childnode. In the example below `<household>` will be populated with data and submitted. The primary instance's single child is the **document root** that XPath expressions are evaluated on (e.g. in the instance below the value of `/household/person/age` is 10).

{% highlight xml %}
<instance>
    <household id="mysurvey" version="2014083101">
        <person>
            <firstname/>
            <lastname/>
            <age>10</age>
        </person>
        <meta>
          <instanceID/>
        </meta>
    </household>
</instance>
{% endhighlight %}

Any value inside a primary instance is considered a default value for that question. If that node has a corresponding input element that value will be displayed to the user when the question is rendered.

Nodes inside a primary instance can contain attributes. The client application normally retains the attribute when a record is submitted. There are 3 pre-defined instance attributes:

| attribute     | description
|---------------|------------
| `id`          | on the childnode of the primary instance: This is the unique ID at which the form is identified by the server that publishes the Form and receives data submissions. For more information see the [CommCare Suite Specification](https://bitbucket.org/commcare/commcare/wiki/Suite20). 
| `version`     | on the childnode of the primary instance can contain any string value.
| `jr:template` | on any repeat group node: This serves to define a default template for repeats and is useful if any of the leaf nodes inside a repeat contains a default value. It is not transmitted in the record. For more details, see the [repeats](#repeats) section.

The primary instance also includes a special type of nodes for metadata inside the `<meta>` block. [pending]() - See the [Metadata](#preloaders---metadata) section

There are 2 separate specs for primary instance nodes that describe _cases_ and _ledgers_:

* [Case XML 2.0](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare/wiki/casexml20)
* [Ledger XML](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare/wiki/ledgerxml)


### Secondary Instances - Internal

Secondary instances are used to pre-load read-only data inside a form. This data is searchable in XPath. At the moment the key use case is in designing so-called _cascading selections_ where the available options of a multiple-choice question can be filtered based on an earlier answer.

A secondary instance should get a unique `id` attribute on the `<instance>` node. This allows apps to query the data (which is outside the root, ie. the primary instance, and would normally not be reachable). It uses the the `instance('cities')/root/item[country='nl']` syntax to do this.

{% highlight xml %}
<instance>
    <household id="mysurvey" version="2014083101">
        <person>
            <firstname/>
            <lastname/>
            <age>10</age>
        </person>
        <meta>
          <instanceID/>
        </meta>
    </household>
</instance>

            <name>haven</name>
        </item>
    </root>
</instance>

### Secondary Instances - External

The previous section discussed secondary instances with static read-only data that is present in the XForm itself. Another type of secondary instances presents read-only data from an _external_ source. The external source can be static or dynamic and is specified using the additional `src` attribute with a URI value on an empty `<instance>` node. Querying an external instance is done in exactly the same way as for an [internal secondary instance](#secondary-instances---internal).

[enketo](# "In theory working in Enketo Express, but not tested and bugs expected.")

{% highlight xml %}
<instance id="towns" src="jr://file/towns.xml"/>
{% endhighlight %}

The following URI variants are supported across CommCare apps (though not in every app):

| URI format                     | description 
|--------------------------------------------|----------------
| `jr://file/FILENAME.xml`                   | points to a local resource similar to how [media](#media) is added to a form. 
| `jr://instance/dbconnector/table/PATIENTS` | points to an instance of type `dbconnector` and the results of the query: `table = patients`
| `jr://instance/casedb`                     | points to all locally stored cases (see the [CaseDb Specification](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare/wiki/casedb))
| `jr://instance/casedb/session/PREGNANCYID` | points to a filtered set of stored cases using a shortcut to the 'session' instance (see the [CaseDb Specification](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare/wiki/casedb))
| `jr://instance/session`                    | points to the current session variables, aka [metadata](#metadata) (see the [Session Specification](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare/wiki/commcaresession))
| `jr://instance/fixture/FIXTUREID`            | points to a fixture (see the [Fixture Specification](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare/wiki/fixtures))
| `jr://instance/ledgerdb`            | points to a ledger (see the [LedgerDb Specification](https://github.com/dimagi/commcare/wiki/ledgerdb))
