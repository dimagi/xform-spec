title: Bindings
---

A `<bind>` element wires together a primary instance node and the presentation of the corresponding question to the user. It is used to describe the datatype and various kinds of logic related to the data. A bind can refer to any node in the primary instance including repeated nodes_. It may or may not have a corresponding presentation node in the [body](#body). 

An instance node does not require a corresponding `<bind>` node, regardless of whether it has a presentation node.

### Bind Attributes

The following attributes are supported on `<bind>` nodes. Only the nodeset attribute is required.

| attribute | description |
| --------- | --------- |
| `nodeset`   | Specifies the [path](#xpath-paths) to the instance node or attribute \[required\].
| `type`      | Specifies the data type. These are discussed below. Considered string if omitted.
| `readonly`  | Specifies whether the user is allowed to enter data, using a boolean expression. Considered `false()` if omitted. [enketo](# "Only the static value `true()` will have an effect in Enketo")
| `required`  | Specifies whether the question requires a non-empty value, options: `true()`, and `false()`. Considered `false()` if omitted.
| `relevant`  | Specifies whether the question or group is relevant. The question or group will only be presented to the user when the XPath expression evaluates to `true()`. When `false()` the data node (and its descendants) are removed from the primary instance on submission.
| `constraint`| Specifies acceptable answers for the specified prompt with an XPath expression. Will only be evaluated when the node is non-empty.
| `calculate` | Calculates a node value with an XPath expression.
| `jr:constraintMsg` | The message that will be displayed if the specified constraint is violated.

[enketo](# "In Enketo nodesets cannot refer to attributes.")

### Data Types

| type 	     | description
|------------|------------
| `string`   | As in [XML 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#string), optionally in "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" namespace
| `int`      | As in [XML 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#int), optionally in "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" namespace

### XPath Paths

XPath paths are used in XForms to reference instance nodes to store or retrieve data. Both absolute and relative paths are supported, along with using the proper relative path context node, depending on the situation. Paths can currently only reference XML elements (not attributes, comments, or raw text). The references `.` and `..` are also supported at any point in the path. 

The following are examples of valid paths:

* `.`
* `..`
* `/`
* `node`
* `/absolute/path/to/node`
* `../relative/path/to/node`
* `./relative/path/to/node`
* `another/relative/path`
* `//node`


### XPath Expressions

All [XPath 1.0 expressions](http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/#section-Expressions) are supported, i.e. `|`, `or`, `and`, `=`, `!=`, `<=`, `<`, `>=`, `>`.

### XPath Predicates

Predicates are fully supported but with the limitations described in [XPath Axes](#xpath-axes) and [XPath Functions](#xpath-functions)

### XPath Axes

Only the _parent_, _child_ and _self_ axes are supported of the [XPath 1.0 axes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath/Axes).

### XPath Functions

A subset of [XPath 1.0 functions](http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/#corelib), some functions of later versions of XPath, and a number of additional custom functions are supported. Some of the XPath 1.0 functions have been extended with additional functionality. 

| function                                  | description |
|-------------------------------------------|------|
| `concat(* arg*)` 							| Deviates from [XPath 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/#function-concat) in that it may contain _1 argument_ and that all arguments can be _nodesets_ or strings. It concatenates all string values and _all node values_ inside the provided nodesets.
| `selected(string list, string value)` 	| Checks if value is equal to an item in a space-separated list (e.g. `select` data type values).
| `selected-at(string list, int index)` 	| Returns the value of the item at the 1-based index of a space-separated list or empty string if the item does not exist (including for negative index and index 0).
| `count-selected(string list)` 			| Returns the number of items in a space-separated list (e.g. `select` data type values).
| `jr:itext(string arg)`                    | Obtains an itext value for the provided reference in the active language. [enketo](# "In Enketo this is not implemented as an XPath function. It is used only for initial form transformation. In practice, that may not make much of a difference.")

| `boolean(* arg)` 							| As in [XPath 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/#section-Boolean-Functions).
| `boolean-from-string(string arg)` 		| Returns true if arg is "true" or "1", otherwise returns false.

| `date (* value)` 							| Converts to date.
| `regex(string value, string expression)` 	| Returns result of regex test on provided value. The regular expression is created from the provided expression string (`'[0-9]+'` becomes `/[0-9]+/`).
| `coalesce(string arg1, string arg2)` 		| Returns first non-empty value of arg1 and arg2 or empty if both are empty and/or non-existent.
| `join(string separator, nodeset nodes*)` 	| Joins the provided arguments using the provide separator between values.
| `substr(string value, number start, number end?)` | Returns the substring beginning at the specified _0-based_ start index and extends to the character at end index - 1.
| `string-length(string arg)`				| Deviates from [XPath 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/#function-string-length) in that the argument is _required_.

| `log10(number arg)`                       | As in [XPath 3.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions-30/#func-math-log10) [enketo](# "not supported in Enketo")
| `upper-case(string arg)`                  | As in [XPath 3.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions-30/#func-upper-case) [enketo](# "not supported in Enketo")
| `contains(string arg)`                    | As in [XPath 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/#function-contains)
| `starts-with(string subj, string search)` | As in [Xpath 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/#function-starts-with)
| `ends-width(string subj, string search)`  | As in [XPath 3.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions-30/#func-ends-with) [enketo](# "not supported in Enketo") 
| `translate(string a, string b, string c)` | As in [Xpath 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/#function-translate)
| `replace(string input, string pattern, string replacement)`| As in [XPath 3.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions-30/#func-replace) [enketo](# "not supported in Enketo")
| `today()`									| Returns today's date without a time component.
| `now()`									| Returns the current datetime in the current time zone.
| `random()`								| Returns a random number between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive).
| `depend(* arg*)`							| Returns first argument. Shouldn't need to be used.
| `uuid(number?)`							| Without arguments, it returns a random [RFC 4122 version 4](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122) compliant UUID. With an argument it returns a random GUID with the provided number of characters.
| `checklist(number min, number max, string v*)`				    | Check wether the count of answers that evaluate to true (when it converts to a number > 0) is between the minimum and maximum inclusive. Min and max can be -1 to indicate _not applicable_.
| `weighted-checklist(number min, number max, [string v, string w]*)`	| Like checklist(), but the number of arguments has to be even. Each v argument is paired with a w argument that _weights_ each v (true) count. The min and max refer to the weighted totals.
| `position()`						        | As in [XPath 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/#function-position).
| `instance(string id)`                     | Returns a [secondary instance](#secondary-instances) node with the provided id, e.g. `instance('cities')/item/[country=/data/country]`. It is the only way to refer to a node outside of the primary instance. Note that it doesn't switch the XML Document (the primary instance) or document root for other expressions. E.g. `/data/country` still refers to the primary instance.
| `current()`                               | In the same league as `instance(ID)` but always referring to the primary instance (and accepting no arguments). Unlike instance(ID), which always requires an absolute path, current() can be used with relative references (e.g. `current()/.` and `current()/..`).  


### Metadata

This section describes metadata about _the record_ that is created with the form. Metadata about _the form itself_ (id, version, etc) is covered in the [Primary Instance section](#primary-instance).

The namespace of the meta block is either the default XForms namespace or `"https://openrosa.org/xforms/"`.

{% highlight xml %}
<instance>
    <data xmlns:jrm="http://dev.commcarehq.org/jr/xforms" xmlns="http://openrosa.org/formdesigner/C59FC6EE-2AD7-4DD5-892A-72DED4338CDE" uiVersion="1" version="637" name="Case Create">
        <question2/>
        <casename/>
        <confirm/>
        <orx:meta xmlns:cc="http://commcarehq.org/xforms">
            <orx:deviceID/>
            <orx:timeStart/>
            <orx:timeEnd/>
            <orx:username/>
            <orx:userID/>
            <orx:instanceID/>
        </orx:meta>
    </data>
</instance>
{% endhighlight %}

These meta elements have corresponding `<bind>` elements with a calculation. _Note that calculations may be recalculated, e.g. when a draft record is loaded. This could lead to undesirable results especially in case the result is a random value._ 

[enketo](# "Enketo will vigorously ignore any calculate attribute on meta/instanceID to keep the value stable.")

Another approach for adding meta data to a record is to use [actions](#actions) and [external instances](#external-instances) (e.g. a session instance).

[enketo](# "Enketo doesn't support actions.")

[enketo](# "Enketo will magically populate known meta nodes, as mentioned below even if they have no bindings.")

The following meta elements are supported:

| element      | description                                       | default datatype | default value             | namespace
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `instanceID` | The unique ID of the record [required]            | string           | concatenation of 'uuid:' and uuid() | same as meta block
| `timeStart`  | A timestamp of when the form entry was started    | datetime         | now()                     | same as meta block
| `timeEnd`    | A timestamp of when the form entry ended          | datetime         | now()                     | same as meta block
| `userID`     | The username stored in the client, when available | string           |                             | same as meta block
| `deviceID`   | Unique identifier of device. Guaranteed not to be blank but could be 'not supported'. Either the cellular IMEI (with imei: prefix, e.g. imei:A0006F5E212), WiFi mac address (with mac: prefix, e.g mac:01:23:45:67:89:ab), Android ID (e.g. android_id:12011110), or another unique device ID for a webbased client (with domain prefix,e .g. enketo.org:SOMEID) | string | depends on client, prefixed | same as meta block
| `deprecatedID` | The `<instanceID/>` of the submission for which this is a revision. This revision will have been given a newly generated `<instanceID/>` and this field is populated by the prior value. Server software can use this field to unify multiple revisions to a submission into a consolidated submission record. | string | concatenation of 'uuid:' and uuid() | same as meta block
